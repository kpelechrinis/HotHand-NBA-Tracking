# HotHand-NBA-Tracking

This is the code for the analysis presented in our paper:

K. Pelechrinis, W. Winston, "The Hot Hand in the Wild"

Some additional results that are not presented in the paper include the estimation of the hot hand effect for players that had at least 500 shots during the 2014-15 season. These results are in the ```hot_hand500.csv``` file. Out of 97 qualified players, there are, 16 players with an empirical p-value less than 0.05. This result has a less than 3-in-100,000 chance of being obtained purely by chance.
